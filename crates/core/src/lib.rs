//! Shared logic for Fizl ApiCraft: the catalog model, compressed-JSON storage,
//! Postman import/export, curl/PowerShell generation, auth schemes, SOAP,
//! gRPC, GraphQL and OData helpers, and the engine that runs requests and workflows. It does no
//! I/O itself (sending goes through [`http::Transport`]), so it runs both
//! natively and in wasm.
